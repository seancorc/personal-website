Some amount of movement is much better than none as it can promote blood flow &amp; reduce atrophy of the affected area. If you&rsquo;re still feeling pain when performing the movement slowly &amp; controlled then probably should give it more rest and consider seeing a physical therapist or doctor.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Engineering</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">There&rsquo;s always a simpler &amp; more elegant solution.

An important nuance is that the assistant doesn&rsquo;t have any specialized training. They just have a general understanding of the world &amp; access to your data. To specialize the assistant in a specific task you would need to have them do that task then give them feedback on what they did good and what they did bad &amp; repeat that a bunch of times. That&rsquo;s what fine-tuning is. If you then give the assistant tools so it can execute actions, it becomes an agent.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Leadership</span></p><p class="c1"><span>When giving critique: If you have a g</span><span class="c2">ood relationship with an individual you should give frank, direct feedback because it&rsquo;s faster.
